# Simple-PasswordManager-with-Dear-ImGui-C-
When i startet watching Frameworks for GUI in C++ i found Dear ImGui. Here i tried some simple stuff with it. The Password Manager doesnt has any encryption or hashes included. I only wanted to combine a GUI with some File management so if you store your Passwords inside this programm, all your data gets saved into a .txt File named
,,Password_Manager_passwords'' (You can for sure change anything for your needs). The project doesnt has any connection to the Internet so everything is stored locally.
